Laptop-Request-Catalog-Item

Modern organizations rely on efficient IT service management systems to handle hardware requests. The Laptop Request Catalog Item simplifies the process of requesting, approving, and tracking laptop allocations for employees. Instead of relying on manual communication, this catalog-driven approach ensures standardized requests, automated approval workflows, and transparent tracking.

It helps IT teams maintain inventory control, reduce delays, and ensure users receive laptops that match their role and access needs. The system also integrates with access control policies to assign necessary permissions once the laptop is issued, ensuring a secure and seamless provisioning process.
